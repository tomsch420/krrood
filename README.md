# KRROOD
KRROOD stands for Knowlege Representation & Reasoning Through Object Oriented Design. This project aims to provide a
unified way to represent and reason about knowledge in Python using the principles of object oriented design.

This project also is consistent with many of the ideas mentioned in the book
[Knowledge Representation and Reasoning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/knowledge-representation-and/9781558609327/).
And of course the books about object oriented design.
