ORMatic Overview
========

ORMatic is a subpackage of KRROOD designed to integrate Python **dataclasses** with the **SQLAlchemy ORM**.
It operates by generating a SQLAlchemy declarative model layer, offering utilities for translating between
domain objects (dataclasses) and database representations (rows).

This approach promotes a separation between the domain model and the persistence mechanism, allowing developers
to concentrate on business logic while abstracting underlying database implementation and SQLAlchemy specifics.

Core Assumptions and Modeling Rules
-----------------------------------
To ensure unambiguous translation and an ergonomic generated ORM, ORMatic adheres to the following rules for dataclass modeling:

- **Protected Fields:** Any dataclass field name beginning with ``_`` is ignored for persistence. These protected fields are suitable for transient or derived runtime data.
- **Optional Types:** The only supported union is :py:class:`Optional[T] <typing.Optional>`. Other unions should be modeled using a shared superclass.
- **Collections:** Iterables must be non-optional and non-nested. For an "optional list," use a default factory that returns an empty collection.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Inheritance is supported and generates `joined-table <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/inheritance.html>`_ inheritance. Note that only the *first* base class in a multiple inheritance structure is considered for queries using abstract classes.
- **Type Discipline:** Dataclass fields require concrete, non-ambiguous type annotations. Prefer small dataclasses or value objects over primitive types when modeling relationships.

When dataclasses cannot conform to these patterns, the following alternatives are available:

- **Alternative Mapping:** Explicit mapping classes can be provided to control how a dataclass is persisted.
- **Type Decorator:** Custom type decorators can be supplied for specialized value types.
Detailed information on these options is provided in the :ref:`alternative_mapping` section.

What ORMatic Generates
----------------------
Execution of ORMatic on a set of classes produces a module containing:

- ``Base``: An SQLAlchemy :py:class:`DeclarativeBase <sqlalchemy.orm.DeclarativeBase>` that manages metadata and a ``type_mappings`` registry for custom types.
- ``*DAO`` Classes: One class per dataclass (and per explicit mapping). Each is a SQLAlchemy declarative model that includes:
  - Columns for fields with built-in or custom types
  - Foreign keys and relationships inferred from nested dataclasses and collections
  - ``__mapper_args__`` for inheritance and polymorphic configuration

ORMatic analyzes the dataclass structure to identify scalar fields, one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many associations. This information is then used to generate a full, decoupled SQLAlchemy declarative layer via a Jinja template.

Persisting Objects
------------------------
- :py:func:`krrood.ormatic.dao.to_dao`: Converts a dataclass instance into its corresponding DAO object, including recursive conversion of nested elements.
- :py:func:`krrood.ormatic.dao.DataAccessObject.from_dao`: Converts a loaded DAO instance back into the original dataclass, including nested components and collections.
